## Module 8 Reflection

### Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For this project, I worked on building a pirate intelligent agent that could find a treasure in a maze environment. I was given starter code that included the maze setup, the environment, and parts of the deep Q learning training structure. My main task was to complete the training algorithm so that the agent could learn how to navigate the maze efficiently. I created the code that defined how the agent stores its experiences, updates its learning model, and chooses actions based on its current state. I also tuned parameters like the learning rate and exploration rate to help the agent learn better over time. In the end, I was able to train the agent to find the treasure successfully without hardcoding specific paths.

### Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

* What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists create solutions for real problems by using technology and logical thinking. They design algorithms, develop software, analyze data, and build systems that make life easier, safer, or more efficient. This matters because so much of what we do in today's day and age depends on computers, from communication to transportation to healthcare. Their work shapes how we interact with technology and can solve problems humans can’t handle alone because of the scale or complexity involved.
    
* How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I approach a problem by first understanding what the end goal is, then breaking it down into smaller steps to figure out what needs to be built or solved first. I try to look at different solutions, sometimes working backwards, and think about which one is the most efficient or practical for the problem. For example, with this project, I learned that I couldn’t just tell the agent where to go. I had to set up the environment and let it learn through reinforcement, testing parameters and making improvements each time to get better results.
    
* What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

As a programmer, I have a responsibility to make sure that what I create is reliable, safe, and fair to users. I need to think about how the technology I create affects people, especially in areas like data privacy, potential biases, and unintended consequences. After this project, I've thought more about how an intelligent agent making decisions needs to be designed carefully so it works the way it’s intended and doesn’t cause harm, especially if used in real robotics or navigation. Ethically, it’s important to build systems that are accurate and protect users’ data and trust.
